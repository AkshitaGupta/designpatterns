/*
The decorator pattern shows us how we can use composition to get the flexibility we want without all the complexity.

Open close principe: This principle says that classes should be open for extension but closed for modification.
For eg: We want to leave our design open for new beverage types and condiments but closed in the sense that we don't
want to touch existing code.
